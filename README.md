# FiveThirtyEight Archive

This repository is an archive of FiveThirtyEight's GitHub repositories, created for preservation purposes due to [the recent announcement of FiveThirtyEight's deactivation.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/07/fivethirtyeight-nate-silver-election-polls/).

For many of us working in, covering, or observing politics, FiveThirtyEight's data - especially on the quality of pollsters and their polls - was an absolutely critical resource.

This repository is an effort to archive what portions of their work we could in the event that the original files are deleted from GitHub by ABC.
