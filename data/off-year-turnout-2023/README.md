# Off-year turnout 2023

This directory contains various demographic data about U.S. counties and county-level voter turnout in off-year elections. It was used in the 538 article, “[High suburban turnout may be the new norm](https://abcnews.go.com/538/high-suburban-turnout-new-norm/story?id=105792075),” by Tia Yang, Mary Radcliffe and Holly Fuong (December 21, 2023). 

Each CSV is broken down by state. You can also access selected data used in this analysis from all five states in the spreadsheet `off-year-turnout-2023.xlsx` in this repo, which includes county-level turnout rates in off-year elections since 2011 and 2023 turnout rates in relation to data on race, education, urbanicity and the 2020 presidential election. 

Voter turnout data is included for off-year elections in which a major statewide office, a statewide ballot question or state legislative elections were on the ballot.
