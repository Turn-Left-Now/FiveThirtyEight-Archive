*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We originally received a data set from the City of Baltimore Law Department that was incomplete and did not overlap with publicly available data we found online. After months of trying to get in contact with the department to figure out why our data was truncated, we were finally able to get a data set from the Mayor’s Office that appeared to be closer to the complete universe of data we were looking for, although it was not directly responsive to our FOIA. The final data set includes cases settled from 2015 through June 2020. We believe the data set may not include all cases from 2015, as the number is quite low. “Closed_date” in this case comes from “date resolved.” The data set was missing all incident dates. The only row missing a filed_date was the Freddie Gray settlement, likely because that was settled pre-litigation. The data we got from the Mayor’s Office included judgments and dismissed cases, which did not fall under the scope of our FOIA. We filtered out rows that were missing “amount_awarded” and those where the amount awarded was $0. The data includes cases in which the city is the sole defendant.
