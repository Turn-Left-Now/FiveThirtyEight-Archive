# Baton Rouge, LA

*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received nine different PDFs from 2010 through 2019 (excluding 2016) that included a brief narrative of events, along with settlement information. 

Based on the summaries, we created a spreadsheet and included any suits against the city or police department that would classify as misconduct (e.g. false arrest or imprisonment, wrongful death or civil rights violations). We excluded motor vehicle accidents that were not clearly due to misconduct. 

The city could not provide a report for 2016 due to flooding that year, so we compiled the information from the 2016 agendas from the Baton Rouge Metropolitan Council, which approves all settlements over $10,000. City officials confirmed that the information we gathered from the agendas was complete and most likely represented the whole universe of settlements from that year, as most lawsuits settled under $10,000 are related to motor vehicle accidents rather than misconduct. 

The PDF files were created by year, so we have a calendar year that should correspond with "closed date" and ranges from 2010 to 2019. The closed date variable is missing for most cases. Where available, it comes from a variable named "Closed Date"
