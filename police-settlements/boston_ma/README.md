# Boston, MA

*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received a table from Boston titled "Allegations of Civil Rights Violations, including Excessive Force, false arrest, wrongful conviction by the Boston Police Department Ending in Settlement." The cases in the table span from January 2010 to May 2019. We did no filtering, as the spreadsheet only included cases that met our criteria. The data includes cases in which the city is the sole defendant.
