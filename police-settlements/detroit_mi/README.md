*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received settlement data in PDF form from 2010 through 2019. We filtered out cases related to FOIAs, vehicles/auto accidents, breach of contract, and pensions. There are a number of cases (about 20) with ambiguous allegations like "Injunctive Relief," "General Office" etc that have been left in. “Closed_date” in this case comes from a column called “pmt date,” which we assume is payment date.
