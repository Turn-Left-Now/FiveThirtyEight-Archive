*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received data regarding litigated claims closed between 2011 and 2019. Four “closed dates” were missing from the data, likely due to pending legal fees. We didn’t filter out any cases, which leaves some ambiguous settlements (including those related to “property damage). There may be other settlements that exist in which only the city was listed as the defendant, but we cannot be sure as we did not receive that specific litigation information. We interpreted "Indemnity Paid" as "amount_awarded"; "Expense paid" as "other expenses"; "collection" as "collection"; "Total Incurred" as "total_incurred."
