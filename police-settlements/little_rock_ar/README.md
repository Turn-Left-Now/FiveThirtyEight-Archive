*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We created a data set based on individual complaints and a general list of settlements we received. The data included “incident year” ranging from 2008 to 2015 and “filed year” ranging from 2009 to 2017, but included no information on when the settlement was reached. We filtered out employment-related settlements. The data includes cases in which the city is the sole defendant, so we believe this is the whole universe of settlements related to police misconduct for the given time period.
