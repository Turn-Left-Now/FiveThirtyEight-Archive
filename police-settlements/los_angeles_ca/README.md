*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received a data set for settlements and claims from FY 2010-20. “Calendar year” refers to the second half of the fiscal year. We filtered out all cases with the following words in their description: "Traffic Accident," "Trip and Fall," "Employment," "FLSA," "Veteran,"  and "Whistleblower" This still leaves some cases that are ambiguous, e.g.: Discrimination cases, Sexual Assault /Harassment, negligence, " Civil Rights - Not otherwise classified," "Dangerous condition," and "Property Related" cases. Closed date here comes from disposition date (i.e. settlement date). The duplicates in the data set are due to settlements split up into multiple payments. This means the data reflects the number of payments per year, rather than the number of cases settled per year. The data includes cases in which the city is the sole defendant, so we believe this is the whole universe of settlements related to police misconduct for the given time period.
