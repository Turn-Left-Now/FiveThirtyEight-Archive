*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received settlement data with monetary amounts for 2013 through 2019 and settlement data without monetary amounts for 2011 and 2012. Any duplicates are imperfect duplicates that are the result of payments split into different installments or broken up into settlements, fees and expenses. There was a "payment type" variable that usually takes on "Settlement" or "Judgement" value, but sometimes has other descriptors (e.g. "interest payment") where it's not totally clear if this should be amount_awarded or other_expenses. We've retained all monetary info in amount_awarded variable and retained the payment type information in case_outcome variable. The claim_number variable comes from "City File Number." The data includes cases in which the city is the sole defendant, so we believe this is the whole universe of settlements related to police misconduct for the given time period. We did not receive data on when each case was settled, so we used only the calendar year.
