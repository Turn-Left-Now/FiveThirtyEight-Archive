# Miami, FL

*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received two PDF files from Miami: Police Settled Matters 1-1-10 to7-1-20 and Police Settled Matters 1-1-10 to 7-1-20 with Summary (1). The latter contained more description of each case, but both contain the same 178 cases. We made the first file machine-readable, and manipulated the sheet to produce a usable data set with the 178 cases. We excluded employment-related cases, ones labeled "MVA - Other," "MVA - Bicycle / Pedestrian" and "Public Records." We kept "torts" cases because at least one had a description that was definitely excessive force, while others did not have any description. We kept some cases labeled “subrogation” but excluded others with descriptions that clearly sounded like MVA cases. The final data set has no perfect duplicates. The field “claim_number” comes from "matter ID," “filed_date” comes from "served date," and “closed_date” comes from "date closed." We believe this data set includes only settlements and not claims. The data includes cases in which the city is the sole defendant, so we believe this is the whole universe of settlements related to police misconduct for the given time period.
