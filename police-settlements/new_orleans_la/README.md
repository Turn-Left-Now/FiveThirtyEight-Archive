*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received a PDF containing settlements closed between 2010 and 2019. We filtered out settlements categorized as “PI - Auto Accident” and “PI - Police Accident.” The field “closed_date” comes from “disposition” and “amount_awarded” comes from “Settlement of judgment amount.” The data includes cases in which the city is the sole defendant, so we believe this is the whole universe of settlements related to police misconduct for the given time period.
