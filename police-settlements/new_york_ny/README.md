# New York City, NY

*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received an extensive data set from the Office of the New York City Comptroller with cases settled between January 2010 and December 2019. We created a column named “location,” which combined four separate columns in the original data set. “Closed_date” in this case comes from “settlement date.” We used a [glossary of terms from the Comptroller’s office](https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/documents/Claims-Report-FY-2019.pdf) to determine which types of claims fell within the scope of our investigation. We filtered out the following: "admiralty," "admiralty (pi)," "automobile accident," "automobile accident (pi)," "building and property (pi)," "buildings and property," "contract," "correction facility (pi)," "damage by city personnel," "defective sidewalk (pi)," "defective roadway (pi)," "defective traff/light/sign (pi)," "disputes," "employee uniformed service," "employee uniformed service (pi)," "equitable," "health facility (pi)," "recreation (pi)," "salary," and "sewer overflow." We left in the following: "civil rights claims," "hybrid," "miscellaneous," "peace officer (police act)," "peace officer/police action (pi)," "personal injury" and "refund." Out of the 32,632 rows remaining, the majority are Peace Officer/Police Action (PI), and almost all of the rest are civil rights claims. It is unclear whether this data set includes cases related to police misconduct where the city was the sole defendant.
