# Philadelphia, PA

*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received settlement data from cases closed between 2009 and 2019. We cleaned the data in a spreadsheet and an R script. We found 18 duplicates on docket number, 10 of which had different amounts and plaintiff names. The remaining duplicates were also imperfect, which we interpreted to mean the settlement was paid out in multiple installments or to multiple payees. We believe this data may be over-inclusive, as we received no information on type of misconduct, despite our subsequent reporting attempts. It is unclear whether this data set includes cases related to police misconduct where the city was the sole defendant.
