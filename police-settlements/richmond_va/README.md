# Richmond, VA

*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received settlement data for cases closed between 2010 and 2020. We used the narratives in the data set to determine whether the cases met our filtering criteria. Of 25 cases provided to us, we found that only four were related to police misconduct. The city was listed as a defendant in some cases in the original data set, but not in the cases we kept. 
 
After we reached out for follow-up reporting, the city sent us seven more cases, of which six were related to police misconduct (based on the narrative in the description field). We added those to the existing four cases. For one of the new cases, the closed date was missing from the column, but the description noted the date the settlement was agreed on, so we added that as the “closed_date.”
