*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received data from two cases settled in 2010 and 2011. Based on follow-up reporting, we believe these two cases represent the entire universe of data we requested. The records did not include a description of the allegations for one of the cases. It is unclear whether this data set includes cases related to police misconduct where the city was the sole defendant.
