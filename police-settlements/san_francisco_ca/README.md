*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received settlement data for cases paid between 2010 and 2019. The field “closed_date” in this case is from “payment date” and “matter_name” came from “file name.” We included all cases where “police” was listed under summary_allegations. This includes: excessive force, unlawful arrest, unlawful entry, unlawful seizure of property, alleges malicious prosecution, and other. “Matter_name” does not contain much detail on the defendants, so it’s unclear whether the city was listed as the defendant in any case.
