# Springfield, MA

*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received settlement data from cases closed between 2006 and 2020. We filtered out all cases where the amount paid was $0 but kept everything else. It included one $27 million judgment (Case # 3:15-cv-30148) that was later reduced to $6.5 million after an appeal; however, this occurred [after we were sent the data](https://www.fox61.com/article/news/local/new-britain-man-city-of-springfield-ma-rea[â€¦]-settle-of-65-million/520-20bfa0a3-d11a-4a9f-8487-9fece2020b22), so we have left it unaltered. We received no information on case name, so it is unclear whether the city was the defendant in any case.
