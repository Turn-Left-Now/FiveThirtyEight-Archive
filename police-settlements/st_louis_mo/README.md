*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received data for cases settled between 2015-19. We filtered out motor vehicle accident cases, employment cases and one case related to the state’s Sunshine Laws. We kept cases with relevant allegations, including Civil Rights §1983-not employment and Personal Injury where COA_Description is "Other" (not Auto). Three of our included cases remain ambiguous: Two are described as “ "MVA W/ POLICE VEHICLE" and one as "PEDESTRIAN STRUCK BY POLICE VAN.” In this case, the field “amount_awarded” came from “value amount” and “closed_date” came from “settle date.” We retained an additional variable labeled “voucher date” but are unclear about its meaning. The data includes cases in which the city is the sole defendant, so we believe this is the whole universe of settlements related to police misconduct for the given time period.
