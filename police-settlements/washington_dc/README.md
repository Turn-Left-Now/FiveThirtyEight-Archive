# Washington, DC

*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received settlement data for cases closed between 2010 and March 2019. In trying to get the rest of the data (March–December 2019), we were then sent several other files, none of which seemed complete and with partially overlapping dates (and containing in part the same cases, but not entirely). We were also not provided with enough information to reliably de-duplicate the data sets if we had tried to combine them. We had reason to believe the second data set was too narrow for our purposes and the third went back only to 2015, so we used only the first data set after back-and-forth with the department, entitled “MPD Cases Final List 08 06 20.” (The “original” folder also contains the two other data sets we were sent.) We concluded that in rows where everything is missing except for "Disposition outcome," "disposition date," and "disposition value," it's because it's part of the same case as the last non-empty row. We've filled in NAs from top to bottom if everything but those three variables are missing. (Rows with more sporadic missingness were left alone.) “Closed_date” in this case comes from “status date.” We did not receive any cases in which the city was listed as the sole defendant, meaning there may have been more settlements related to police misconduct paid out during this time frame that were not included in the data set.
