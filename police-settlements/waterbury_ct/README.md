*This data is a part of a FiveThirtyEight/The Marshall Project effort to collect comprehensive data on police misconduct settlements from 2010-19. See the [data dictionary here](../) and [the story here](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/police-misconduct-costs-cities-millions-every-year-but-thats-where-the-accountability-ends).*

We received settlement data for cases closed between 2011-19. We filtered out cases labeled "MVA" (motor vehicle accident) and labeled "MVA- UM/UIM" (uninsured/underinsured motorist). We kept cases where the allegation was clearly misconduct (e.g. excessive force, wrongful death, assault), as well as four more ambigious cases labled MVA/Pursuit, MVA-personal injury, "Mandatory reporter, duty to report alleged sexual abuse" and "Defamation, libel, slander." The data includes cases in which the city is the sole defendant, so we believe this is the whole universe of settlements related to police misconduct for the given time period.
