VictoryChart
=============

A flexible charting component for React. VictoryChart composes other victory components into reusable charts. Acting as a coordinator rather than a stand-alone component, VictoryChart reconciles props such as `domain` and `scale` for child components, and provides a set of sensible defaults.

VictoryChart includes:

- [VictoryAxis](http://victory.formidable.com/docs/victory-axis)
- [VictoryArea](http://victory.formidable.com/docs/victory-area)
- [VictoryBar](http://victory.formidable.com/docs/victory-bar)
- [VictoryLine](http://victory.formidable.com/docs/victory-line)
- [VictoryScatter](http://victory.formidable.com/docs/victory-scatter)
